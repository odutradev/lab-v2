# Fullstack monorepo guide

This repository holds the API in `api/` and the frontend in `ui/`. This guide defines the root rules: structure, scripts, environment variables, Docker, docker-compose, nginx, commits and publishing. Following it is **mandatory**.

**Directive:** before changing an app, read its guide: `api/CLAUDE.md` for the API and `ui/CLAUDE.md` for the frontend. Each app's code, architecture and naming rules live there.

**Reply language:** always talk to the user in Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR): answers, explanations, questions, plans and summaries. This guide is written in English only because AI models follow English instructions more reliably. Code, identifiers and commit messages follow the rules below.

## 1. Repository structure

```text
.
├── api/
│   ├── .dockerignore
│   ├── CLAUDE.md  # API guide
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── package.json
│   └── src  # API code
├── ui/
│   ├── .dockerignore
│   ├── CLAUDE.md  # frontend guide
│   ├── Dockerfile

├── .env.example
├── docker-compose.yml
└── package.json
```

- Each app is independent: it has its own `package.json`, `tsconfig`, lint and build. Dependencies are installed in the app's folder.
- The root `package.json` only orchestrates the apps. It has no code and no runtime dependencies.
- No import crosses apps. The frontend talks to the API over HTTP only, through its actions layer.
- When an API contract changes, the response types are mirrored in the frontend in the same work.

## 2. Scripts and local development

- **Runner:** npm workspaces. A raiz declara os apps em workspaces e roda scripts com -w.
- `npm run dev` at the root starts everything. Use `dev:api` or `dev:web` to start a single app.
- `npm run build` builds both apps. Run it before calling a task done.

```json
{
  "name": "monorepo",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["api", "ui"],
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "concurrently -n \"api,web\" \"npm run dev:api\" \"npm run dev:web\"",
    "dev:api": "npm run dev -w api",
    "dev:web": "npm run dev -w ui",
    "build": "npm run build:api && npm run build:web",
    "build:api": "npm run build -w api",
    "build:web": "npm run build -w ui",
    "lint": "npm run lint -w ui",
    "up": "docker compose up -d --build"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "concurrently": "^9.1.2"
  }
}
```

## 3. Environment variables

- **Location:** Um .env na raiz. Um único .env e .env.example na raiz, lido pelo docker-compose e pelos dois apps.
- Never commit `.env`. Every new variable goes into `.env.example` with a safe example value.
- Variables read by the frontend use the `VITE_` prefix and are public: never put secrets in them.
- `VITE_API_URL` points to the API's public URL in each environment.

## 4. Docker and deploy

### Docker

- Each app has a multi-stage `Dockerfile` in its own folder: a `builder` stage (`npm ci` and build) and a `runner` stage with only what is needed to run.
- Base image for Node stages: `node:22-alpine`. Do not change the version unless asked.

- API: the runner installs production dependencies only (`npm ci --omit=dev && npm cache clean --force`), copies `dist` from the builder, sets `NODE_ENV=production` and `PORT=80` and runs `node dist/server.js`.
- Frontend: Vite variables come in as `ARG` and become `ENV` before the build (`VITE_API_URL`), because Vite inlines them into the build. Never read secrets in the frontend.
- The frontend runner is `nginx:alpine` serving `dist` with the app's `nginx.conf`.
- Every container listens on port 80. The external port is set in compose or in the deploy.
- Every folder with a `Dockerfile` has a `.dockerignore` that ignores `node_modules`, `dist`, `.git`, `.env`, `.env.*` and docs. Never copy `.env` into the image: configuration comes from environment variables.

### docker-compose

- One `docker-compose.yml` at the root, with one service per app plus the support services.

- Every service uses `restart: unless-stopped` and the same `app-network` bridge network.
- Inside the network, apps reach services by name (`redis://redis:6379`), never `localhost`.
- Published ports use a variable with a default: `"${PORT:-5000}:80"`. Secrets have no default.
- `depends_on` sets the startup order: support services before the API and the API before the frontend.
- Every new variable goes into `.env.example` and into the compose service in the same commit.

### Nginx

- nginx serves the frontend static build with SPA fallback: `try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html`.
- The API does not go through nginx: it is exposed on its own port or domain, and the frontend calls `VITE_API_URL`.
- `gzip` on for text, JS, CSS, JSON and SVG.
- Security headers on every response: `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options` and `Referrer-Policy`.
- Cache: `/assets/` for 1 year and `immutable`; `index.html` never cached so updates are instant.
- The `/healthz` endpoint returns 200 for the healthcheck.

## 5. Commits and Git

- **Format:** Conventional Commits. `<type>: <short description>`, with type one of `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test` and `chore`. Imperative verb, no trailing period.
- **Language:** Commit messages in English.
- **Granularity:** Step by step. One commit right after each finished step of the work, in order.
- **Scope:** No scope. Only the type before the colon.
- **Message:** Subject only. One short line, up to 72 characters.
- **When to commit:** When the task is done. Commit without waiting to be asked, as soon as each part is ready and typecheck, lint and tests pass.
- **AI co-authorship:** No AI co-authorship. Never add `Co-Authored-By` or any mention of AI to messages.
- **When finished:** after the last commit, list every commit made in the task, one per line, as `{hash} {message}`, using the short hash.
- Never commit environment files (`.env`), secrets, builds or `node_modules`.
- **Branches:** type/description. Change type prefix and a kebab-case description.

Example history for a feature:

```text
1a2b3c4  feat: add user profile schemas and repository
240eb3d  feat: add update profile action
2df22b6  feat: add profile types and actions
37d5a2f  feat: add profile page
41b91a8  chore: add profile env vars to compose
```

```text
feat/user-profile
fix/login-redirect
docs/readme
```

## 6. Publishing

This project publishes with [project-publisher](https://www.npmjs.com/package/project-publisher). npx. Runs without installing anything in the project.

| Flag | Step | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `--bump-package` | Bump version | Increments the package.json patch (1.0.9 becomes 1.1.0). |
| `--push` | Push to git | Runs git add, commit "chore: bump version to X" and pushes the branch. |

Steps run in flag order. Default command:

```bash
npx project-publisher --bump-package --push
```

**Before publishing:**

- Commit all of the task's work following the commit rules. The `--push` flag runs `git add .` and creates the commit `chore: bump version to X`: any pending change would end up in that commit.
- The working tree must be clean, except for what publishing itself changes.
- The push goes to the `master` branch.
- The bump only raises the patch. To change minor or major, edit the version in `package.json` by hand before running.

### Required question at the end of every task

When you finish **every** task that changed files, after committing as described in the commits section and with typecheck, lint and build passing, your last action is to ask whether to publish. Use the interactive question tool (`AskUserQuestion`), which shows a box with buttons:

- **Question:** "Do you want to bump the version and publish?"
- **Header:** "Publish"
- **Options:**
  - **Yes, publish**: bump version, push to git → runs `npx project-publisher --bump-package --push`
  - **Not now**: Nothing is published.

If the tool is not available, ask the same question in text as the last line of your reply, listing the options.

- Only run the command for the chosen option. On "Not now", run nothing and do not ask again in the same task.
- Do not ask when the task changed no files (questions, reads or explanations only).
- Do not ask if the build, tests or typecheck failed: fix them first or say that publishing is blocked.

## 7. App guides

- **API (`api/`):** `api/CLAUDE.md`
- **Frontend (`ui/`):** `ui/CLAUDE.md`

Claude Code loads the folder's CLAUDE.md when working in it. Read the app's guide before creating or editing code in it.

## 8. Checklist before delivering

- [ ] API code stayed in `api/` and frontend code in `ui/`, following each app's guide.
- [ ] No import crosses apps. The frontend talks to the API over HTTP only.
- [ ] Changed API response types were mirrored in the frontend.
- [ ] New environment variables were added to `.env.example` and `docker-compose.yml`.
- [ ] New dependencies were installed in the right app's `package.json`, never at the root.
- [ ] Publish question asked as the last action, if the task changed files.
